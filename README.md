# Ruby on Rails Capstone Project.

In this project, I built a website based on lifestyle articles. I used a lot of knowledge acquired throughout the Ruby on Rails section, Model/View/Controller concepts, some of HTML & CSS, among other knowledge acquired on Microverse to create an MVP for this app.

The project consists of a Sing up/Login with username. The user is presented with the homepage. When the user clicks the category name they can see all articles in that category.
